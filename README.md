This Python code is used to find the optimal discount rate that maximizes revenue based on previous sales data. The user is prompted to input the number of sales made at two different discount rates.

The angular coefficient of the line that connects the two data points is calculated using the formula (discount2 - discount1)/(sales2 - sales1). This value is used to define a function R(x), which represents revenue as a function of the discount rate.

The minimize() function from the scipy.optimize library is used to find the discount rate that maximizes revenue. This function takes the R(x) function and an initial guess as inputs and returns the optimal discount rate that maximizes the revenue.

The minimize() function is used to minimize the negative of the revenue function, which is equivalent to maximizing the revenue function. The maxsales variable contains the result of the minimize() function, which includes the optimal discount rate that maximizes revenue.

Finally, the optimal discount rate and expected revenue are calculated based on the output of the minimize() function. The Dmaxrevenue variable is used to calculate the optimal discount rate, while the expected revenue is calculated by multiplying the optimal discount rate and expected number of sales.

Overall, this code provides a simple and effective way to find the optimal discount rate that maximizes revenue based on past sales data. It can be useful for businesses and individuals looking to optimize their pricing strategies.
